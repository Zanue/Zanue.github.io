## Core Idea
**Propose an anchor-free single-stage LiDAR-based 3D object detector – RangeDet.**

<br/>


## Background

Advantages and disadvantages of Range-view:

1. The range view is widely adopted in semantic segmentation task, but it is rarely used in object detection task individually.
2. Organizing the point cloud in range view misses no information.
3. The compactness also enables fast neighborhood queries based on range image coordinates, while point view methods usually need a time-consuming ball query algorithm to get the neighbors.
4. The valid detection range of range-view-based detectors can be as far as the sensor’s availability, while we have to set a threshold for the detection range in BEV-based 3D detectors.


However, there is still a huge gap between the pure range-view-based method and the BEV-based method. For example, on the validation split of Waymo Open Dataset (WOD), *they are still lower than state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (more than 20 points 3D AP in vehicle class)*.


Some facts on the different designs of RV and BEV:
1. **scale variation**: the challenge of detecting objects with sparse points in BEV is converted to the challenge of scale variation in the range image.
2. **input 2D output 3D**: unlike in 2D image, though the convolution on range image is conducted on 2D pixel coordinates, while the output is in the 3D space.
3. **compactness**: the 2D range view is naturally more compact than 3D space, which makes feature extractions in range-image-based detectors more efficient.

Corresponding solutions:
1. **Range Conditioned Pyramid**
2. **Meta-Kernel**
3. **Weighted Non-Maximum Suppression**
