## DETR3D: 3D Object Detection from Multi-view Images via 3D-to-2D Queries

### Contributions
1. Different from existing works that combine object predictions from the different camera views in a final stage, our method fuses information from all the camera views in each layer of computation. To the best of our knowledge, **this is the first attempt to cast multi-camera detection as 3D set-to-set prediction**.
2. introduce a module that connects 2D feature extraction and 3D bounding box prediction via backward geometric projection. It does not suffer from inaccurate depth predictions from a secondary network, and seamlessly uses information from multiple cameras by back-projecting 3D information onto all available frames.
3. method does not require post-processing such as per-image or global NMS, and it is on par with existing NMS-based methods. In the camera overlap regions, our method outperforms others by a substantial margin.
