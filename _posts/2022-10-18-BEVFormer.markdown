## TL;DR
BEVFormer = **Predefined Grid-shaped BEV Queries** + **BEV Temporal Self-Attention** + **BEV Spatial Cross-Attention** + Det & Seg Heads.


## Motivation
- 3D object detection task requires strong BEV features to support accurate 3D bounding box prediction, but generating BEV from the 2D planes is ill-posed;
- BEV methods based on depth information is sensitive to the accuracy of depth values or the depth distributions.

Therefore, authors are motivated to design *a BEV generating method that does not rely on depth information and can learn BEV features adaptively rather than strictly rely on 3D prior*.
