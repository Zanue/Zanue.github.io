## Pseudo-LiDAR from Visual Depth Estimation: Bridging the Gap in 3D Object Detection for Autonomous Driving

### Contributions

1. show empirically that a major cause for the performance gap between stereo-based and LiDAR-based 3D object detection is not the quality of the estimated depth but its *representation*
2. propose pseudo-LiDAR as a new recommended representation of estimated depth for 3D object detection and show that it leads to state-of-the-art stereo-based 3D object detection
